  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I enjoy using data science and AI to solve real world problems.</strong> My passion is using data science for social and environmental issues such as climate change and social inequality.
    When I am not data sciencing, I enjoy hiking, yoga, and sci-fi. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Besides my work as a data scientist, I work as a senior researcher at the University of Geneva. 
    I primarily investigate evidenced-based climate change communication strategies to facilitate increased pro-environmental behaviors. 
    To this end, I am developing and experimentally evaluating different psychological intervention methods aimed at sustainable behavior change.
