  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong> With over 8 years of experience working in consulting, industry, academia, and government, I help organizations understand and leverage 
    the full potential of their data.</strong> I focus on applying machine learning, deep learning, and survey methodology techniques in the Marketing, 
    Finance, and Cybersecurity domains to improve data-based decision-making. When I am not data sciencing, I enjoy hiking, yoga, and sci-fi. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Besides my work as a data scientist, I work as a senior researcher at the University of Geneva. 
    I primarily investigate evidenced-based  communication strategies to facilitate behavior change. 
    To this end, I am developing and experimentally evaluating different psychological intervention methods aimed at behavior change.
